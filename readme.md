# Workflows course

Basic review of OS web dev tools for building a responsive SPA.

## Offered through Lynda.com

Accessed through my public library's subscription. Taking this as a top level refresher on some stuff I am already familiar with (more or less), such as Git and Sass, and also learning some new stuff, such as Gulp, that I want to apply to other projects. 

### Taught by Ray Villalobos

Ray is a good instructor. See his [Github page](https://github.com/planetoftheweb) for more information.
