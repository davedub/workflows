Basic review of OS web dev tools for building a responsive SPA.

Accessed through my public library's subscription. This is a refresher  course on Git and Sass, but also introduces me to Gulp and Browserify, which I have not used before.

### Taught by Ray Villalobos

Ray is a good instructor. See his [Github page](https://github.com/planetoftheweb) for more information.
